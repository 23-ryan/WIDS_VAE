# WIDS VAE
The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) project aims to explore and implement a powerful generative model for image regeneration. This project will focus on understanding VAE architecture and then using it to generate realistic images by training it on a given dataset of images.

In this project, the workflow is as follows. Firstly, data preprocessing will be done on the image dataset to enhance its suitability for training. Following this, the Variational Autoencoder architecture will be implemented using ML-libraries. The model will then undergo training using a specified dataset, allowing it to learn latent representations. Finally, the the trained VAE will be tested by generating new images, showcasing its ability to produce novel and realistic outputs.
